# Conway's Game of Life

My Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

In my implementation, '*' and '.' represent living and dead nodes, respectively.


To run it:

Open as a project in your Java SDE. When prompted for a seed file, you should input either "lib/seed.txt" or a valid path to your own seed file.
