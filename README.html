<h2>My C++ implementation of Conway's <em>Game of Life</em>.</h2></br>

<p>In my implementation, '*' and '.' represent living and dead nodes, respectively.</p></br>

To run it:</br>
<ul>
<li>Compile the program in your command line. (i.e. "g++ Game.cpp")</li>
<li>Execute the generated executable file. (i.e. "./a.out")</li>
<li>You will be asked for the name of a seed file. Enter "seed.txt". You may edit this file to represent a different starting state. You may also enter the name of or path to a different seed file.</li>
<li>Enter the number of generations to cycle through. Only the final generation will be written to the "next-gen.txt" file.</li>
<li>Tests run by default. You may comment them out in the <em>main</em> function of the "Game.cpp" file.</li>
</ul></br>
