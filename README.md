# Conway's Game of Life

My C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

In my implementation, '*' and '.' represent living and dead nodes, respectively.


To run it:

Compile the program in your command line (i.e. "g++ Game.cpp").
Execute the generated executable file (i.e. "./a.out").
You will be asked for the name of a seed file. Enter "seed.txt". You may edit this file to represent a different starting state. You may also enter the name of or path to a different seed file.
Enter the number of generations to cycle through. Only the final generation will be written to the "next-gen.txt" file.
Tests run by default. You may comment them out in the <em>main</em> function of the "Game.cpp" file.
